## Python Basics    
## Data Structures         
         >> Lists         
         >> Tuples           
         >> Dictinory       
         >> Sets         
## Functions       
## Object Oriented Programming (OOPs concept)          
## Exceptional Handling         
           >> try          
           >> except          
           >> raise     
## File Handling            
          >> read       
          >> write      
          >> append       
          >> seek       
                
All these concepts I studied and practiced.     
Here are the codes and in-built functions of **Python** performed in **jupyter notebook**.        

## Machine Learning        
I have used some Machine Learning concepts using **Python** which includes **numpy, pandas, open cv and data visualization**.
