## Python Basics    
## Data Structures         
         >> Lists         
         >> Tuples           
         >> Dictinory       
         >> Sets         
## Functions         
         >> Return statement        
         >> local and global variable           
         >> default argument values        
         >> Packing arguments       
         >> Lambda functions         
         >> Decorators        
         >> *args and **kwargs
## Object Oriented Programming (OOPs concept)      
         >> __init__ method     
         >> Dunders and magic function          
         >> Inheritance         
         >> Polymorphism         
         >> Encapsulation               
         >> Abstraction       
## Exceptional Handling         
           >> try          
           >> except          
           >> raise     
## File Handling            
          >> read       
          >> write      
          >> append       
          >> seek       
                
All these concepts I studied and practiced.     
Here are the codes and in-built functions of **Python** performed in **jupyter notebook**.        

## Machine Learning        
I have used some Machine Learning concepts using **Python** which includes **numpy, pandas, open cv and data visualization**.
